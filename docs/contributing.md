# Submitting pull requests

Contributions and contributors are always welcome! If you have decided to work on an issue, please comment before you 
start the actual work to check if somebody else is not already working on it. If nobody is working, please create a fork
of <a href="https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox" target="_blank">strongbox/strongbox</a> and create a branch from 
the `master` which has the issue number you will be working on. For example, if the issue number is `1004`, the branch
name should be `issue-1004`.  
  
While working on the issue, please commit using the following messaging format:

```
Issue 1004: Title of the issue

- Removing unused class and fixing failing test cases
- Oh, look, another necessary change here!
```

Once you're done with your work - feel free to open a Pull Request. Our CI will build the entire code and report any
failing tests. In case of issues (i.e. build failures), please ping us in the chat.  
  
Please continue reading our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
