# Writing a layout provider

## Concept

We've tried to devise our architecture in a generic way that's easy to extend and work with.

The illustration below is a top level overview of how artifact management is implemented in Strongbox within 
[Storages], [Repositories] and [Layout Providers]:

![Strongbox Repository Layout Concept][concept]

There are three layers and each of them decorates the underlying layer with the logic it's responsible for. 
For example, the following layer implementations are possible:

**Repository**

* Hosted
* Proxy
* Group

**Layout**

* Maven
* NPM
* NuGet
* Raw

**Storage**

* File system
* AWS S3 (not yet implemented)
* Google Cloud (not yet implemented)

All of the layers are loosely coupled, so implementations don't depend on each other. With the **Decorator Pattern** 
concept you can have any layer implementation combinations you need: `Hosted`+`Maven`+ `File System`, `Group`+ `Npm`+ `AWS` etc. 

## Layout Implementation

We can say that artifacts are just regular files, so our implementation is mainly based 
on the common [JDK File I/O (Featuring NIO.2)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileio.html) entities. 

This is how it looks like:

![Strongbox Repository, Layout and Storage Provider Classes][classes]

You will need to implement the following entities:

- `ConcreteLayoutFileSystemProvider`
- `ConcreteLayoutFileSystem`
- `LayoutProvider`
- `ArtifactCoordinates`

### Artifact Coordinates

Each layout implementation should be able to identify artifacts and the [Artifact Coordinates] serves this purpose.

These are the minimal requirements for [ArtifactCoordinates.java] implementations: 
- Each `ArtifactCoordinates` implementation should have an `id` and `version`.
- Each `id` and `version` pair must be unique per repository.
- There should be a transitive function to get `ArtifactCoordinates` from `Path` and vice-versa.

!!! info "Notes"
    * Each layout implementation should be placed in separate module under the `strongbox-storage/strongbox-storage-layout-providers` module.
    * There should be thorough unit tests that check the implementation
    * There should be a layout-specific **Artifact Generator** implemented which will be used for test purpose

### Artifact Controller

Once you have created your module and created an implementation of the `ArtifactCoorsinates`, you can start implementing 
the protocol specific API. Most of the build and artifact management tools are using HTTP to interact with their 
end-points and in Strongbox we use [Spring MVC] for this. The [BaseArtifactController.java] should be extended with 
protocol-specific API methods (download, upload etc.).

!!! info "Notes"
    There should be REST Assured based unit tests to check that artifact downloads/uploads handled with `HTTP 200` response code


### Layout specific I/O extension

To make the layout implementation truly usable, there should be some layout specific I/O, such as Streams 
(`InputStream`, `OutputStream`) and **File System** related entities (`FileSystemProvider`, `FileSystem`, `LayoutProvider`).
  
Below is the set of base classes which need to be extended:

- `LayoutFileSystem`
- `LayoutFileSystemProvider`
- `AbstractLayoutProvider`

Almost all components in Strongbox are managed by Spring's IoC container, the same goes for the layout-related 
components and there should be the following factories to put everything into context:

- `LayoutFileSystemProviderFactory`
- `LayoutFileSystemFactory`

### Putting It All Together

Strongbox has plugable layout providers, so once you have implemented all the extension points, it should work out of the box.

Below you can see how the general flow goes, based on the artifact download example:
