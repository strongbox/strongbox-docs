# Getting started with persistence

## Abstract

This page contains explanations and code samples for developers who need to store their entities into the database. 

The Strongbox project uses [OrientDB](http://orientdb.com/orientdb/) as its internal persistent storage through the 
corresponding `JPA` implementation and `spring-orm` middle tier. Also we use `JTA` for transaction management and 
`spring-tx` implementation module from Spring technology stack.

## OrientDB Studio

As you are learning about Strongbox persistence, you may want to explore the existing persistence implementation.
For development environments, Strongbox includes an embedded OrientDB server as well as an embedded instance of
OrientDB Studio. By default, when you run the application from the source tree, you'll use the embedded database
server. However, OrientDB Studio is disabled by default.

### Running OrientDB Studio From Source Tree

To enable OrientDB Studio, you need only to set the property `strongbox.orientdb.studio.enabled` to `true`. You
can do this on the Maven command line by running Strongbox as follows:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dstrongbox.orientdb.studio.enabled=true"
```

There are two additional properties that can be used to configure OrientDB Studio:

- `strongbox.orientdb.studio.ip.address`
- `strongbox.orientdb.studio.port`

### Running OrientDB Studio From The Distribution

If you're running from the `tar.gz`, or `rpm` distributions, you can start Strongbox as follows to enable OrientDB Studio:

```
$ cd /opt/strongbox
$ STRONGBOX_VAULT=/opt/strongbox-vault STRONGBOX_ORIENTDB_STUDIO_ENABLED=true ./bin/strongbox console
```

Please note that the `STRONGBOX_VAULT` environment variable needs to be pointing to an absolute path for this to work.

As with the source distribution, you can set additional environment variables to further configure OrientDB Studio:

```
$ export STRONGBOX_ORIENTDB_STUDIO_IP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
$ export STRONGBOX_ORIENTDB_STUDIO_PORT=2480
```

Once the application is running, you can login to OrientDB Studio by visiting
http://127.0.0.1:2480/studio/index.html in your browser. The initial credentials are `admin` and `password`.

After your login, you'll land on the Browse Screen, which allows you to query the embedded database.

Finally, you can explore the schema defined in the database by clicking `SCHEMA`.

## Adding Dependencies

Let's assume that you, as a Strongbox developer, need to create a new module or write some persistence code in an 
existing module that does not contain any persistence dependencies yet. (Otherwise you will already have the proper 
`<dependencies/>` section in your `pom.xml`, similar to the one in the example below). You will need to add the 
following code snippet to your module's `pom.xml` under the `<dependencies>` section:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>strongbox-data-service</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Notice that there is no need to define any direct dependencies on OrientDB or Spring Data - it's already done via 
the `strongbox-data-service` module.

## Creating Your Entity Class

Let's now assume that you have a POJO and you need to save it to the database (and that you probably have at least 
CRUD operations implemented in it as well). Place your code under the `org.carlspring.strongbox.domain.yourstuff` 
package. For the sake of the example, let's pick `MyEntity` as the name of your entity.

If you want to store that entity properly you need to adopt the following rules:

* Extend the `org.carlspring.strongbox.data.domain.GenericEntity` class to inherit all required fields and logic from 
  the superclass.
* Define getters and setters according to the `JavaBeans` coding convention for all non-transient properties in your 
  class.
* Define a default empty constructor for safety (even if the compiler will create one for you and you don't define any 
  other constructors) and follow the `JPA` and `java.io.Serializable` standards.
* Override the `equals() `and `hashCode()` methods according to java `hashCode` contract (because your entity could be 
  used in collection classes such as `java.util.Set` and if you don't define such methods properly other developers or 
  yourself will be not able to use your entity).
* _Optional_ - define a `toString()` implementation to let yourself and other developers see something meaningful in 
  the debug messages.

The complete source code example that follows all requirements should look something like this:

```java
package org.carlspring.strongbox.domain;

import org.carlspring.strongbox.data.domain.GenericEntity;

import com.google.common.base.Objects;

public class MyEntity
        extends GenericEntity
{

    private String property;

    public MyEntity()
    {
    }

    public String getProperty()
    {
        return property;
    }

    public void setProperty(String property)
    {
        this.property = property;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o)
    {
        if (this == o)
        {
            return true;
        }
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass())
        {
            return false;
        }
        
        MyEntity myEntity = (MyEntity) o;

        return Objects.equal(property, myEntity.property);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode()
    {
        return Objects.hashCode(property);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString()
    {
        final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("MyEntity{");
        sb.append("property='").append(property).append('\'');
        sb.append('}');
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## Creating a DAO Layer

First of all, you will need to extend the `CrudService` with the second type parameter that corresponds to your ID's data type. Usually it's just strings. 


!!! tip "To read more about ID's in OrientDB, check the <a href='http://orientdb.com/docs/2.0/orientdb.wiki/Tutorial-Record-ID.html' target='_blank'>manual</a>"

```java
package org.carlspring.strongbox.users.service;

import org.carlspring.strongbox.data.service.CrudService;
import org.carlspring.strongbox.users.domain.MyEntity;

import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

/**
 * CRUD service for managing {@link MyEntity} entities.
 *
 * @author Alex Oreshkevich
 */
@Transactional
public interface MyEntityService
        extends CrudService<MyEntity, String>
{

    MyEntity findByProperty(String property);

}
```

After that you will need to define an implementation of your service class. 

Follow these rules for the service implementation:

* Inherit your CRUD service from the `CommonCrudService<MyEntity>` class.
* Name it like your service interface with an `Impl` suffix, for example `MyEntityServiceImpl`.
* Annotate your class with the Spring `@Service` and `@Transactional` annotations.
* Do **not** define your service class as public and use an interface instead of a class for injection (with `@Autowired`). 
  This follows the best practice principles from Joshua Bloch 'Effective Java' book called Programming to Interface.
* _Optional_ - define any methods you need to work with your `MyEntity` class. These methods should mostly be based on 
  common API form `javax.persistence.EntityManager`, or custom queries (see example below).

* !!! warning "Avoid query parameters construction through string concatenation!"
      Please avoid using query parameter construction through string concatenation!  
      This usually leads to [SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) issues!    
      Bad query example:  
      `String sQuery = "select * from MyEntity where proprety='" + propertyValue + "'"`;  
      What you should do instead is to create a service which properly assigns the parameters.  
      Here's an example service:
      ```java
      @Transactional
      public class MyEntityServiceImpl
              extends CommonCrudService<MyEntity> implements MyEntityService
      {
          public MyEntity findByProperty(String property)
          {
              String sQuery = "select * from MyEntity where property = :propertyValue";

              OSQLSynchQuery<Long> oQuery = new OSQLSynchQuery<Long>(sQuery);
              oQuery.setLimit(1);

              HashMap<String, String> params = new HashMap<String, String>();
              params.put("propertyValue", property);
      
              List<MyEntity> resultList = getDelegate().command(oQuery).execute(params);
              return !resultList.isEmpty() ? resultList.iterator().next() : null;
          }
      }
      ```

## Register entity schema in EntityManager
Before using entities you will need to register them. Consider the following example:

```java
@Inject
private OEntityManager oEntityManager;

@PostConstruct
public void init() 
{
    oEntityManager.registerEntityClass(MyEntity.class);
}
```
