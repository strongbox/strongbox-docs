# Getting started with persistence

## Abstract

This page contains explanations and code samples for developers who need to store their entities into the database. 

The Strongbox project uses [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org/) as its internal persistent storage through the 
corresponding [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) implementation and [spring-data-neo4j](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-neo4j#overview) middle tier. We also use `JTA` for transaction management and the `spring-tx` implementation module from the Spring technology stack.

## Persistence stack

We're using the following technology stack to deal with persistence:

 - Embedded Cassandra as direct storage (`CassandraDaemon` allows us to have the Cassandra instance inside the same JVM as the application)
 - JanusGraph as our graph DBMS (it is not directly a data storage, it just allows you to have access to data in the form of a graph)
 - [Apache TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/) as a set of tools to interact with the database
 - [spring-data-neo4j](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j) to manage transactions in Spring with `Neo4jTransactionManager` and implement custom Cypher queries with Spring Data repositories (by custom queries via the `@org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.Query` annotation)
 - [cypher-for-gremlin](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin) which translates Cypher queries into Gremlin traversals (it has some issues which prevent us from using it for `neo4j-ogm` CRUD operations, these issues will be explained below)
 - [neo4j-ogm](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm) to map Java POJOs into Vertices and Edges of Graph
 - We also use custom `EntityTraversalAdapters`, which implement anonymous Gremlin traversals for CRUD operations under `neo4j-ogm` entities.

## Vertices and Edges

Unlike a relational DBMS, Graph DBMS have vertices and edges, not rows and tables. So, in terms of Graph, every persistent entity should be stored as vertex or edge. An example of a vertex might be `Artifact` or `AritfactCoordinates` and the relation between them would be an edge. It should be noted that, unlike RDBMS, object relations are represented by a separate edge, instead of just a foreign key column in a table. In addition to vertices, persistence objects can also be edges -- for example, the `ArtifactDependency` would be an edge between `ArtifactCoordinates` vertices.

## Gremlin Server

`TODO`


## Adding Dependencies

Let's assume that you, as a Strongbox developer, need to create a new module, or write some persistence code in an 
existing module that does not contain any persistence dependencies yet. (Otherwise you will already have the proper 
`<dependencies/>` section in your `pom.xml`, similar to the one in the example below). You will need to add the 
following code snippet to your module's `pom.xml` under the `<dependencies>` section:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>strongbox-data-service</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Notice that there is no need to define any direct dependencies on JanusGraph or Spring Data - it's already done via 
the `strongbox-data-service` module.

## Creating Your Entity Class

Let's now assume that you have a POJO and you need to save it to the database (and that you probably have at least 
CRUD operations implemented in it as well). Place your code under the `org.carlspring.strongbox.domain` 
package. For the sake of the example, let's pick `PetEntity` as the name of your entity.

If you want to store that entity properly you need to adopt the following rules:

* Create the interface for your entity with all the getters and setters that are required to interact with the entity, according to the `JavaBeans` coding convention. This interface should extend `org.carlspring.strongbox.data.domain.DomainObject`. We need an interface in order to hide the implementation-specific details that depend on the underlying database, such as inheritance strategy.
* Create the entity class which implements the above interface and extend to `org.carlspring.strongbox.data.domain.DomainEntity`.
* Declare an entity class with `@NodeEntity` or `@RelationshipEntity`.
* Define a default empty constructor, as this would be required in order to create entity instances from `neo4j-ogm` internals.

The complete source code example that follows all requirements should look something like this:

```java
package org.carlspring.strongbox.domain;

@NodeEntity("Pet")
public class PetEntity
        extends DomainEntity
        implements Pet
{

    private Integer age;

    public PetEntity()
    {
    }

    @Override
    public Integer getAge()
    {
        return age;
    }

    @Override
    public void setAge(Integer age)
    {
        this.age = age;
    }

}
```

## Creating a `EntityTraversalAdapter`

As mentioned above, besides `neo4j-ogm` and `spring-data-neo4j`, we were forced to use custom CRUD implementations based on Gremlin. This has its advantages, as it allows us to optimize OGM entities and make them faster than what the common `neo4j-ogm` provides out of the box. The main thing of the Gremlin based CRUD is `EntityTraversalAdapter` which is a strategy for create/update/read/delete operations. The concrete `EntityTraversalAdapter` provides [Anonymous Traversals](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlins-anatomy/) for each operation of the specific entity type. These traversals are used in Gremlin-based repositories to perform common CRUD operations:

- `fold` : to construct entity instance based on vertex/edge and its properties
- `unfold` : to extract entity properties into vertex/edge and its properties
- `cascade` : to cascade other vertices/edges within delete if needed

Basically these all these operations are implemented using special `__` class, which represent anonymous traversal in Gremlin.

The `EntityTraversalAdapter` implementations can also use each other to support relations between entities, inheritance and cascade operations.

Below is the code example of `EntityTraversalAdapter` implementation for `PetEntity`:

```java
package org.carlspring.strongbox.gremlin.adapters;

import static org.carlspring.strongbox.gremlin.adapters.EntityTraversalUtils.extractObject;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

import org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.Traverser;
import org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.Element;
import org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.Vertex;
import org.carlspring.strongbox.domain.Pet;
import org.carlspring.strongbox.domain.PetEntity;
import org.carlspring.strongbox.gremlin.dsl.EntityTraversal;
import org.carlspring.strongbox.gremlin.dsl.__;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class PetAdapter extends VertexEntityTraversalAdapter<Pet>
{

    @Override
    public Set<String> labels()
    {
        return Collections.singleton("Pet");
    }

    @Override
    public EntityTraversal<Vertex, Pet> fold()
    {
        return __.<Vertex, Object>project("uuid", "age")
                 .by(__.enrichPropertyValue("uuid"))
                 .by(__.enrichPropertyValue("age"))
                 .map(this::map);
    }

    private Pet map(Traverser<Map<String, Object>> t)
    {
        PetEntity result = new PetEntity();
        result.setUuid(extractObject(String.class, t.get().get("uuid")));
        result.setAge(extractObject(Integer.class, t.get().get("age")));

        return result;
    }

    @Override
    public UnfoldEntityTraversal<Vertex, Vertex> unfold(Pet entity)
    {
        EntityTraversal<Vertex, Vertex> t = __.<Vertex>identity();
        if (entity.getAge() != null)
        {
            t = t.property(single, "age", entity.getAge());
        }
    
        return new UnfoldEntityTraversal<>("Pet", t);
    }

    @Override
    public EntityTraversal<Vertex, ? extends Element> cascade()
    {
        return __.identity();
    }

}

```

## Creating a `Repository`

All the database interactions should be done through repositories. For the compatibility with `spring-data`, we use `org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository` as a basis for our repositories. The base class for implementing `EntityTraversalAdapter`-based repositories is `org.carlspring.strongbox.gremlin.repositories.GremlinRepository`. Further repository implementation depends on the type of entity; for vertex-backed entities, it should be `GremlinVertexRepository`.
In addition to CRUD operations, there is also the need to be able to select data using queries. Queries could be implemented using [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/) through `spring-data-neo4j` using the `@org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.Query` annotation. So, the final repository should be a mixin that extends `GremlinRepository` and delegates custom `Cypher` queries to the `org.springframework.data.repository.Repository` instance provided by `spring-data-neo4j`.

Putting together all the above, the repository for the `PetEntity` will look like below:

```java
package org.carlspring.strongbox.repositories;

import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.carlspring.strongbox.domain.Pet;
import org.carlspring.strongbox.gremlin.adapters.PetAdapter;
import org.carlspring.strongbox.gremlin.repositories.GremlinVertexRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public class PetRepository extends GremlinVertexRepository<Pet>
        implements PetQueries
{

    @Inject
    PetAdapter adapter;
    
    @Inject
    PetQueries queries;

    @Override
    protected PetAdapter adapter()
    {
        return adapter;
    }

    List<Pet> findByAgeGreater(Integer age)
    {
        return queries.findByAgeGreater(age);
    }

}

@Repository
interface PetQueries
        extends org.springframework.data.repository.Repository<Pet, String>
{

    @Query("MATCH (pet:Pet) " +
           "WHERE pet.age > $age " +
           "RETURN pet")
    List<Pet> findByAgeGreater(@Param("age") Integer age);

}
```

## Issues of `cypher-for-gremlin` and `neo4j-ogm`

The first issue that we have, is the fact that `cypher-for-gremlin` does not fully suport all Cypher syntax that is produced by `neo4j-ogm` for CRUD operations. To be more specific, on every CRUD operation, `neo4j-ogm` generates a Cypher query which is then translated to Gremlin by `cypher-for-gremlin`. As a workadound, we modify Cypher queries produced by `neo4j-ogm` and replace some clauses (see `org.opencypher.gremlin.neo4j.ogm.request.GremlinRequest`). 

Another issue is that `cypher-for-gremlin` has an ambiguous concept for working with `null` values in Gremlin. They put a lot of noisy tokens into Gremlin traversals which prevents the JanusGraph engine from matching expected indexes. This, in term, causes heavy full-scans on every query (see [#342](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/issues/342)). This was the main reason why we couldn't use the `neo4j-ogm` for CRUD operations.

Either way, we are still using it for custom Cypher queries via the `@org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.Query` annotation. This is a good option to have Cypher queries, instead of Gremlin ones, because it looks more clear and takes less time to read and write queries.
